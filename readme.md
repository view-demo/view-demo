GitHub & BitBucket Mockup Preview
---------------------------------

Many GitHub repositories don't use GitHub Pages to host their HTML files. **GitHub & BitBucket Mockup Preview** allows you to render those files without cloning or downloading whole repositories. It is a client-side solution using multiple CORS proxies to fetch assets.

If you try to open the raw version of any HTML, CSS or JS file in a web browser directly from GitHub, all you will see is the source code. GitHub forces them to use the "text/plain" content-type, so they cannot be interpreted. This tool overrides it by using CORS proxies.

## Usage

To use it, simply enter the URL of an HTML file from GitHub or BitBucket on our website: **[https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/](https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/)** 

Alternatively, you can prepend this fragment to the URL of any HTML file: **[https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/?](https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/?)** 

For example:
 - https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanghoong/mockup/refs/heads/master/sample/bootstrap-5-album.html
 - https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanghoong/mockup/refs/heads/master/sample/bulma-landing-page.html
 - https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanghoong/mockup/refs/heads/master/sample/tailwind-dashboard.html
 - https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanghoong/mockup/refs/heads/master/sample/foundation-blog-template.html
 - https://www.tanghoong.com/mockup/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanghoong/mockup/refs/heads/master/sample/vue-calendar-app.html

What it does: The tool loads HTML using CORS proxies, then processes all links, frames, scripts and styles, loading each of them using CORS proxies so they can be evaluated by the browser.

**GitHub & BitBucket Mockup Preview** has been tested with the latest versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other modern browsers.
